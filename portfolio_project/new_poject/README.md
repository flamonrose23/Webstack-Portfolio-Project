BUILDING TASK MANAGEMENT APP FOR PORTFOLIO WWEBSTACK PROJECT


To run the  project on your laptop, follow these steps:

1. Install Dependencies
You need to install the necessary packages for both the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js + Express).

a. Navigate to the Backend Directory(./server):
**cd ../path/to/todoms/server** 
Then, run:
**npm install**
This installs all the backend dependencies listed in package.json.

b. Navigate to the Frontend Directory(./client):
**cd ../path/to/todoms/client** 
Then, run:
**npm install**
This installs all the frontend dependencies.

2. Set Up Environment Variables
Make sure you have the required environment variables. Typically, there’s a .env.example file or similar. You can create a .env file in both the frontend and backend directories and fill in the necessary variables (like MONGODB_URI, PORT, JWT_SECRET, etc.).

3. Run the Backend
Navigate to the backend directory and run:

**cd ../path/to/todoms/server**
and run :


**npm start**

This should start your backend server.

4. Run the Frontend
In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and run:
**npm run dev**
This should start the frontend React app on a local development server.

5. Database Setup
If the project uses MongoDB, ensure MongoDB is running on your machine or via a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas. If it’s a local MongoDB, you may need to run:

**mongod**
